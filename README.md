# Create Your Own Image Classifier

Create an image classifier for images of flowers.

## Results:

A classifier using the pre-trained network [MobileNet](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4) and one output layer with 102 neurons shows an accuracy of 78,25% and can predict the flower class of 4 test images.

## Strategy:

Use the [Oxford Flowers 102 datset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102) to train a deep learning model and then use the trained model to classify new images of flowers.
